<h1>About</h1>
<section>
    <p>Webdwelling is a small project I have undertaken both as an exercise in becoming more familiar with Go, and to
        create a digital home on the web, independent of browser and device.</p>
    <p>One reason I chose Go was that it is a compiled language, which means that Webdwelling should be able to run on
        a wide range of servers, including cheap VPSs and even Raspberry Pis with minimal slowdown.</p>
    <p> I aim to include several features in Webdwelling, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A bookmark manager and viewer</li>
        <li>A calendar capable of sourcing events from CalDAV servers</li>
        <li>A customisable RSS feed</li>
        <li>A customisable homepage, integrating the above features to create a personal point of entry to the web</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I hope you enjoy using Webdwelling!</p>
