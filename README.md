# webdwelling
Webdwelling is a small project I have undertaken both as an exercise in becoming more familiar with Go, and to create a
digital home on the web, independent of browser and device.

One reason I chose Go was that it is a compiled language, which means that Webdwelling should be able to run on a wide
range of servers, including cheap VPSs and even Raspberry Pis with minimal slowdown.

I aim to include several features in Webdwelling, including:

- A bookmark manager and viewer
- A calendar capable of sourcing events from CalDAV servers
- A customisable RSS feed
- A customisable homepage, integrating the above features to create a personal point of entry to the web

I hope you enjoy using Webdwelling!
